I'm revising some topics in mathematics, and these are my notes.

## Topic: Linear Algebra

Text: *Introduction to Linear Algebra Fifth Edition by Gilbert Strang.*

### Problem set 1.1

#### 1.

Descibe geometrically (line, plane, or all of $\mathbb{R}^3$) all linear combinations of

(a) $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} $ and $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 6 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix} $

Here we see that $v_2 = 3v_1$, therefore these two vectors are collinear.  Their linear combinations describe a line through the origin and $v_1$ (which also contains $v_2$).

(b) $\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $ and $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} $

These two vectors are not collinear.  There is no constant $k$ such that $v_2 = kv_1$.  Therefore these two vectors describe a plane that contains the origin, $v_1$ and $v_2$.

(c) $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $ and $\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} $ and $\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} $

None of these three vectors can be described as a linear combination of the others, therefore they describe the entire $\mathbb{R}^3$ plane.
